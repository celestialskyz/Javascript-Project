## Background and Overview
With Corona being the top story causing massive shut downs of the global economy and travel bans, I want to create a site that can track the cases with a lighthearted theme & bring some positive quarantine activities to help us all through.

## Functionality & MVPs 
-bar graph of a random selection of 8 countriesâ€™ cases cases.
-interactive and show data points.
-fun suggestions for things to do in quarantine.
-allows you to create your own graph based on chosen x and y parameters.
-double bar graph of all the cases, vs deaths, vs recoveries based on input.
